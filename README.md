NRRD support for Javascript
===========================

This can open files in the [Nearly Raw Raster Data format](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/). Currently it only supports inline data (although in principle there is parsing support for datafile), and has only limited "intelligence", but it can be still be useful.

Planned: saving NRRD files as well as opening them, and integration with ndarray.
